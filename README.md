# Introduction
This repository is a remote copy of my subject work. It has a set of questions and every question in it has a independent folder. In those folders, I will show that how to solve the problems via a butch of algorithms. As I am just an apprentice so I can't make sure that there are no bugs or mistakes in it. If you have any questions or just want to have some talk, welcome to reach me via my email:

That's all, thanks for watching.
